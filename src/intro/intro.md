## What the MDAI Engine© is not...

**A proprietary Observability vendor/platform**

The MDAI Engine© will always be fueled by community-driven innovations.

**A standalone monitoring platform**

The MDAI Engine© is primarily focused on configuration of data pipelines and light-weight self-monitoring for Engine behaviors. It cannot replace advanced monitoring platform capabilities at this time.

**A replacement for comprehensive monitoring solutions**

The MDAI Engine© is not - at the moment - to be a full replacement for monitoring your data pipelines.

**A Data Analysis tool**

The MDAI Engine© will not store or analyze your data, rather, it will broker the signal received to the downstream, configured destination(s) where analysis and data visualization will occur.

**A managed service**

The MDAI Engine© is a toolkit that is configured and managed in your infrastructure giving you full control of your solution.

**An exclusive solution for a given CSP**

The MDAI Engine© will grow beyond AWS in the future.


## Why use the MDAI Engine©...
Using the MDAI Engine© can provide you the insights you need to take back control and manage costs associated with data transmission from the source of your telemetry to your chosen observability vendor(s).
