## What the MyDecisive.ai (MDAI) MDAI Cluster is...

**An Open-Source Observability toolkit**

The MDAI Cluster is built as an abstraction layer for complex-to-configure, Open-source and Cloud Provider-managed tools. The MDAI Cluster is powered by AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Prometheus, and a custom-built MDAI Console WebApp.

**An OTLP-Compatible Data Pipeline Configuration and Management Tool**

The MDAI Cluster streamlines setup and configuration OTLP-Compatible data pipelines, enabling effortless deployment and management of telemetry data pipelines.

**A self-monitoring data pipelines solution**

The MDAI Cluster offers a self-monitoring capability to ensure pipeline health, reliability, and performance. The MDAI Cluster monitors ingestion, processing, and transmission processes for the MDAI Cluster enabling proactive troubleshooting and optimization.

## What the MDAI Cluster is not...

**A proprietary Observability vendor/platform**

The MDAI Cluster will always be fueled by community-driven innovations.

**A standalone monitoring platform**

The MDAI Cluster is primarily focused on configuration of data pipelines and light-weight self-monitoring for MDAI Cluster behaviors. It cannot replace advanced monitoring platform capabilities at this time.

**A replacement for comprehensive monitoring solutions**

The MDAI Cluster is not - at the moment - to be a full replacement for monitoring your data pipelines.

**A Data Analysis tool**

The MDAI Cluster will not store or analyze your data, rather, it will broker the signal received to the downstream, configured destination(s) where analysis and data visualization will occur.

**A managed service**

The MDAI Cluster is a toolkit that is configured and managed in your infrastructure giving you full control of your solution.

**An exclusive solution for a given CSP**

The MDAI Cluster will grow beyond AWS in the future.

## Why use the MDAI Cluster...

Using the MDAI Cluster can provide you the insights you need to take back control and manage costs associated with data transmission from the source of your telemetry to your chosen observability vendor(s).
