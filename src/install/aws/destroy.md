## Destroy the MDAI Engine

Tired of using the MDAI Engine? ðŸ˜­ We're sorry to see you go, but we understand. If you have feedback for us, please fill out.

Follow the steps below to destroy the AWS Stack.
Due to AWS CDK limitations several additional steps required to fully remove all MDAI Engine resources from AWS.

- Delete the Open Telemetry Collector
  ```shell
  kubectl delete otelcol/<your_collector_name>
  ```
- Destroy MDAI Engine stack
  ```shell
  cdk destroy --profile <your_aws_profile>
  ```
- The destroy process will run for a while and may return an error due some resources having dependencies.
Delete listed dependencies by following steps below or through AWS Console.

    - Run the command bellow to check if UI load balancer has to be deleted:
        ```shell
        aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers \
        --region <your_region>  \
        --profile <your_profile> \
        --query "LoadBalancers[?contains(LoadBalancerName,'mdai-console')].{ARN:LoadBalancerArn}" \
        --output text
        ```
    - Use the ARN from the command above to delete pending load balancer:
        ```shell
        aws elbv2 delete-load-balancer \
        --load-balancer-arn <your_load_balancer_arn> \
        --region <your_region> \
        --profile <your_profile>
        ```
    - Delete security groups if the destroy failed to delete the VPC. Use the VPC ID from the cdk error output:
        ```bash
        for sg_id in $(aws ec2 describe-security-groups --region <your_region> --profile <your_profile> --filters Name=vpc-id,Values='<your_vpc_id>' --query 'SecurityGroups[?GroupName!=`default`].[GroupId]' --output text); do
            aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-id $sg_id --region <your_region> --profile <your_profile>
            echo "Deleted security group $sg_id"
        done
        ```
- Run the destroy process again.
