## Validate data flow

1. From the last step in [Verify](./verify.md), you should've found your Console UI Load Balance link. Please visit that URL to view your pipeline configuration and dataflow. 
2. As telemetry flows through the MDAI Cluster, you will see counts increase in the console, color-coded by telemetry type. 🐙🎉
