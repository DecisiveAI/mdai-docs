## üîê UI Authentication

We knew it wouldn't be acceptable to leave your precious new resources unprotected and open to any user of the internet!

*Enter Cognito*

We've added the ability to connect [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) easily to your new Engine to limit access for undesired users.
Our installation includes the following resources upon creating an engine:

1. [User pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html) `mdai-user-pool`
2. [App client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html) `mdai-app-client`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Pre-built configuration

The following environment variables need to be defined in `values/aws.env` during the pre-build configuration step:

`MDAI_UI_HOSTNAME`
This is a hostname for the UI endpoint, which is going to be used as a main UI hostname. This should directly relate to a DNS CNAME record, pointing to DNS hostname, generated by AWS for the Load Blancer `mdai-console` endpoint.

`MDAI_UI_USER_POOL_DOMAIN`
This variable contains a prefix for [User pool domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-assign-domain.html).
[Amazon Cognito domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-assign-domain-prefix.html)
is used with this installation, so this variable represents a prefix, for the domain.
This domain name will become a part of the auth redirecting URL.

### üßçUser(s) creation

The only manual step required is a user(s) creation.
Please follow the [Amazon Cognito User Pool documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/managing-users.html) steps
to create users(s) in `mdai-user-pool`.
