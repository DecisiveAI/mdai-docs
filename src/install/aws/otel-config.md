# ‚è≤Ô∏è Time for OpenTelemetry! üìà

Let's update your MDAI Cluster's OTel configuration file.

ü§î You've got a couple options...

## Option 1 - üë¢ Bootstrap our built-in Collector Configuration

We have provided a default configuration for a simplified version of the OpenTelemetry collector at `values/otelcol-config.yaml`. Using our boilerplate can accelerate your deployment and configuration using OpenTelemetry.

*MOARRR CHOICES!*

You can...
1. Use the config as is and update at your will later
2. you can start making modifications right now

Learn more about the specifications for the [OTEL Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) to make the best decisions for your telemetry pipelines configuration needs.


## Option 2 - üß≥ Bring Your Own Configuration
Want to use a custom or tried-and-true OTel configuration file that already works for you?

Simply update the configuration file at `templates/mdai-operator.yaml`.
