# MDAI Nucleus Life Cycle Management

## Overview

MDAI Nucleus lifecycle management involves post-creation operations to control the behavior and state of the components of each nucleus or the nucleus as a whole.

The common use cases for lifecycle management are highlighted below...
1. [Disable Nucleus Ingress](./disable.md) - Disable ingress to validate that data flow has stopped.
2. [Enable Nucleus Ingress](./enable.md) - Enable ingress to validate that data flow has been re-instantiated.
3. [Destroy Nucleus](./destroy.md) - Destroy all artifacts associated with the MDAI Nucleus.


## ðŸš¨ Important considerations for Life Cycle Management ðŸš¨

* Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and access rights to perform these operations.
* Always review and test configurations before applying changes to avoid unintended consequences.
* Use caution when destroying a cluster, as it will permanently delete all associated resources.
