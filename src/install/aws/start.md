2. 🔐 Enable access to your engine via your AWS account settings, whether it's for multiple users or just yourself.
3. 🌎 Use DNS to connect your custom domain to any engine entry-points.
4. 💵 Visualize your pipeline data flows, giving you instant insights into your telemetry cost drivers and the net impact of your defined data processors.
