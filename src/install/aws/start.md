# 🪄 Introduction 🪄

Deploying an MDAI Engine to AWS will allow you to:
1. ☁️ Manage your MDAI Engine in the cloud.
2. 🔐 Enable access to your engine via your AWS account settings, whether it's for multiple users or just yourself.
3. 🌎 Use DNS to connect your custom domain to any engine entry-points.
4. 💵 Visualize your pipeline data flows, giving you instant insights into your telemetry cost drivers and the net impact of your defined data processors.

Future versions of the MDAI Engine will be compatible with other cloud service providers.

## Getting Started

To begin visualizing your telemetry pipelines, you will need to complete the following three steps:

1. Set up and run an AWS instance of the MDAI Engine.
2. Send telemetry to the MDAI Engine.
3. Access the MDAI Engine Console to verify data flowing through the MDAI Engine.
