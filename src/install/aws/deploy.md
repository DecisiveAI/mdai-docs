Ready to see the Engine in action?
<div class="warning">
  Note: After deploying, the engine will be active and running in AWS. There are costs associated with running our engine, however, we've done all we can to make the infrastructure as cost-effective as possible
</div>

### Deploy the MDAIâ„¢ Engine

```shell
make install
```
- Install will check and bootstrap the CDK Toolkit if it's not present for the region.

or AWS Console -> Cloud Formation

- The installation process will add a new context to your `kubeconfig`. You can switch context by running `kubectl config use-context <desired_context>`
Detailed output stored into `cdk-output.json`.

### Verify the MDAIâ„¢ Engine
Ensure your cluster is up and running.
List all namespaces:
```shell
kubectl get ns
```
Expected output

```shell
kubectl get pods
```
Your output for default configuration should be similar to
