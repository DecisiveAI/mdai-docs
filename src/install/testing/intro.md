## What kind of user are you?

### **TelemetryGen** 

I don't have any existing agents/collectors that I can use to send telemetry right now. 

[Start with TelemetryGen now!](./testing/telemetrygen.md)


### **Postman & mock MLT payloads** 

I want to send some payloads using Postman to my MDAI Cluster! 

[Send sample data with Postman](./postman.md)


### **curl or grpcurl & mock MLT payloads** 

I want to use my terminal to send some payloads using Postman to my MDAI Cluster! 

[Send sample data via terminal](./curl_grpcurl.md)


### **Real Collectors, Real pipelines** 

I have existing sources of telemetry I'd love to point to my new MDAI Cluster! 

[Setup your collectors with OTel pipelines now!](./real_collector_agent.md)
