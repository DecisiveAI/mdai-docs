### Automated uninstall
Follow the steps below to remove your local MDAI Engine

#### Ensure you have the correct k8s context selected.

Make sure your k8s context is set to `kind-mdai-local` cluster:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

Switch the context if needed:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-mdai-local
```

#### Destroy Cluster

Run automated de-installation script

```bash
 make -f ./make/Makefile-local-recipes delete-mdai
```

#### Optional: Destroy all helm artifacts

If you want to remove all helm artifacts installed (you don't use it your other local setup), run the following

```bash
 make -f ./make/Makefile-local-recipes delete-mdai-all
```
