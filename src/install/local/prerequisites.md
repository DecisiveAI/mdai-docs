## System Dependencies
Currently, our documentation is tailored for users operating on Linux or Mac computers. Additionally, it assumes you have the following:
  - You have <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">üç∫ homebrew</a> installed.
  - You‚Äôre using __bash__, but you can modify these configurations and commands as needed for your preferred command line interface.
  - If you're using MacOS, you'll also need <a href="https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/" target="_blank">XCode Commandline Tools</a> installed.

### Note on user requirements
We aim to make our solutions accessible to everyone. However, we recommend having an intermediate understanding of OpenTelemetry and Kubernetes, or a strong determination, before proceeding with this installation.

Here are a few great resources for ramping up on these subjects:
* [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/getting-started/)
* [Kubernetes Training](https://kubernetes.io/training/)
