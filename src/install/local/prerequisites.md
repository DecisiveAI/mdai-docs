### User Requirements

We never desire to exclude anyone from using our solutions. Instead we encourage and inspire you to obtain an intermediate knowledge of OpenTelemetry and Kubernetes (or a ton of grit) before continuing with this install. Here's a few great resources for ramping up on these subjects:
* [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/getting-started/)
* [Kubernetes Training](https://kubernetes.io/training/)
