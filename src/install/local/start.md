# 🪄 Quick Start - Introduction 🪄

We hope that deploying an MDAI Engine locally will help you to:

Using our local installation method, we hope to...
1. ⏲️ Help you install our infrastructure in less than 5 minutes.
2. ⚖️ Validate, locally, that the engine is a great tool for your telemetry management needs.
3. 🥰 Fall in love with us and our solution before you install in the cloud.

*Future versions of the MDAI Engine will be constructed with a CLI to reduce the pain of manual install and provide a wizard like experience. 🧙‍♀️ WE appreciate your patience while we work our magic behind the scenes.*
