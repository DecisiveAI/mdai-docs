# Enable Engine Ingress

After completing maintenance or resolving issues, you want to resume incoming traffic and ensure that data flow resumes smoothly.

## How to Enable

1. Apply the configuration to enable ingress using `kubectl apply -f enable-ingress.yaml`.
2. Verify that incoming traffic reaches the cluster again, confirming that data flow has been re-instantiated.
