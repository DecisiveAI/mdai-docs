# Installation
----
## There are three options for installation:

- __Semi-automatic Install__ - I want to install all system dependencies myself to be aware of and manage the MDAI requirements alongside my other software requirements.

- __Automated Install__ - I want the fastest method for installation possible, so I can skip ahead to testing out the MDAI Cluster! I'm not worried about how the system dependencies impact my other development environments.
