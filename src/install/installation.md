# Supported Installation Methods

There are currently two supported methods for installing an MDAI Cluster:
1. **Local** - on your machine
2. **AWS** - in your AWS account

## Local Installation

Check out our [Quick Start Guide](./local/quick-start.md) to learn how to test the MyDecisive MDAI Cluster in a local environment.

## AWS Installation

**Ready to visualize your observability pipelines and identify your top cost drivers?**

Install an MDAI Cluster in [AWS](./aws/start.md).

Additional installation methods will be supported in the future.
