MyDecisive.ai, also known as MDAI, is an Open-source framework
for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as
[traces](/docs/concepts/signals/traces/),
[metrics](/docs/concepts/signals/metrics/), and
[logs](/docs/concepts/signals/logs/).

As an industry-standard, OpenTelemetry is
[supported by more than 40 observability vendors](/ecosystem/vendors/),
integrated by many [libraries, services, and apps](/ecosystem/integrations), and
adopted by [numerous end users](/ecosystem/adopters).
